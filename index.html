          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p class="body">My name is Jordan Alvarado! I am an amateur software enginner, looking to further improve my craft, with a side passion of playing the violin! My childhood was influenced thanks to my grandfather having owned his own computer repair shop. As I got older, I became interested in coding, and proceeded to start taking classes in order to learn about the technology industry. I joined the robotics club during my junior and senior year of high school. There I learned how to program robots. The robots I helped build were entered into battle competitions, with one even taking third place.</p>
